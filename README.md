## Assignment 2 - Linear Models

This assignment involved selecting two medium-sized data sets from online sources, performing data cleaning and exploration on them, and performing machine learning on the data sets using linear models. From there, we are tasked with analyzing the performance of each linear model, and drawing comparisons between them.

## Assignment 3 - Machine Learning from Scratch

This assignment involved implementing the Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Models in C++ from Scratch, and using the models to predict off of the titanic data set.

This assignment was completed in a group of 2, consisting of Myself and Benjamin Frenkel. We each worked on the Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression portions of the assignment correspondingly.

## Assignment 4 - Similarity

This assignment involved utilizing similarity models such as kNN and Decision Trees to predict off of data. It also involves using clustering methods such as kMeans and Hierarchical Clustering, along with dimensionality reductions techniques such as LDA and PCA.

This assignment was completed in a group of 4, consisting of Myself, Linus Fackler, Fernando Colman, and Isabelle Villegas. Each member worked on the Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Dimensionality Reduction portions of the assignment correspondingly.

## Assignment 5 - Kernel and Ensemble Methods

This assignment involved utilizing the SVM Linear Models and their various kernel modes to predict off of both classification and regression data sets. It also involves using various Ensemble Methods to build models for a classification data set.

This assignment was completed in a group of 2, consisting of Myself and Benjamin Frenkel. I'd worked on the Classification and Ensemble Techniques portions of the assignment, while Benji worked on the Regression portion of the assignment.

## Assignment 6 - Machine Learning with SKLearn

This assignment involved exploring machine learning on a data set provided to use using Python's SKLearn library. Most notably, we explore Neural Networks in this assignment, and experiment with various topologies of Neural Networks.
