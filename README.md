[Code](C++%20Data%20Exploration/main.cpp).

## Assignment 2 - Linear Models

This assignment involves selecting two medium-sized data sets from online sources, performing data cleaning and exploration on them, and performing machine learning on the data sets using linear models. From there, we are tasked with analyzing the performance of each linear model, and drawing comparisons between them.
