# CS4375 - MachineLearning
## Overview

This is a repository (sub-portfolio) containing all the programs created for the class, Machine Learning during my 4th year of college.

Notable file(s) include an [overview of the topic of machine learning](Overview/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf), which may help give context to this portfolio and its contents.

## Assignment 1 - C++ Data Exploration

This assignment involves recreating the functionality of various R functions in C++.

Notable file(s) for this assignment include the [results of this assignment](C++%20Data%20Exploration/Data%20Exploration%20Writeup.pdf), as well as the [code written for the assignment](C++%20Data%20Exploration/main.cpp).

## Assignment 2 - Linear Models

This assignment involves selecting two medium-sized data sets from online sources, performing data cleaning and exploration on them, and performing machine learning on the data sets using linear models. From there, we are tasked with analyzing the performance of each linear model, and drawing comparisons between them.

Notable file(s) for this assignment include the write-ups for the [Regression](Linear%20Models/Regression.pdf) ([html format](Linear%20Models/Regression.html)) supervised learning models, and the [Classification](Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf) ([html format](Linear%20Models/Classification.html)) supervised learning models, as well as the R Markdown files written for the [Regression](Linear%20Models/Regression.Rmd) portion of the assignment, as well as the [Classification](Linear%20Models/Classification.Rmd) portion of the assignment.
